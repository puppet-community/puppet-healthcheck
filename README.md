## Types

### tcp_conn_validator

`tcp_conn_validator` is used to verify that a service is listening on a given port.
It could be used to test either a remote or a local service. It support both IPv4 and
IPv6 connection strings. It also works with hostname.

```puppet
tcp_conn_validator { 'foo-machine ssh service' :
  host => '192.168.0.42',
  port   => 22,
}
```

The namevar of this resource can also be the connection string. It comes handy when
one already have an array of ip:port or hostname:port string to test.

```puppet
mongodb_cluster_nodes = ['192.168.0.2:27017', 'node02.foo.bar.com:27017']
tcp_conn_validator { $mongodb_cluster_nodes : }
```

####`host`

####`try_sleep`
